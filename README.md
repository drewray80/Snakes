This is based primarily on a tutorial by LeMaster Tech.  
Build a Simple SNAKE Game with Python! [PyGame Tutorial 2022]

Great tutorial.  
snake_basic.py is the tutorial code with a few features removed for simplification.  
two_player.py is my expansion to add 2 players on the same keyboard.  

**In High School Programming Course**  
I like to use games to teach the basic concepts of OOP.  
This is my favorite game for that purpose.  

It is simple enough for high school students to complete in a few class periods,  
the code to be understandable, and high schoolers right now love snake.  

**snake_basic**
The snake_basic version helps them to understand the bsics of object atributes and methods.  
The design of this program also lets them apply multiple concepts such as lists, functions and loops.  
It also can be used to introduce pygame.  

**two_player**
After making the basic version together, I ask students to expand the game to 2 players.  
After they try to make it 2 player, I show them my 2 player version and let them play.  
They really like this game. It is real time playing against their buddy that is sitting next to them.
